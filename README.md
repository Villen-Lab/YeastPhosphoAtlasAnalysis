### Analysis Repository for the YeastPhosphoAtlas

This repository is home to our preprocessing scripts and notebooks which support the analysis in the YeastPhosphoAtlas
manuscript and web portal. Preprocessing was performed through a Snakemake pipeline, and we are actively working on
making the anaylsis reproducible with a single script. Individual sections of our analysis can be found as R notebooks
under the `notebook` directory and resulting output files can be found under the `notebook/output` subdirectory.
